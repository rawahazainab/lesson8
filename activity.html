    <p> The contribution of computer science (AI) within the field of education has invariably been important. From robotic
    teaching to the event of an automatic system for answer sheet analysis, AI has invariably helped each the lecturers and
    also the students. during this research we've got done thorough analysis of the assorted analysis developments that were
    applied across the world like computer science techniques applied to education sector thus on summarize and highlight
    the role of AI in teaching and studentâ€™s analysis. Our study shows that AI is that the backbone of all the information
    science enabled intelligent tutor systems. These systems helps in developing qualities like self reflection, responsive
    deep queries, partitioning conflict statements, generating artistic queries, and choice-making skills. Introduction
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is present in our lives and is progressing with efficiency in modern times. the start of AI
    are often derived to the 1956 Dartmouth summer scientific research on computer science. Today, AI work is performed in
    police investigation cancer, reducing the danger of plane collisions, and developing autonomous vehicles, etc.
    AI-equipped robots have outperformed human surgeons in stitching up cuts; acting search and rescuing missions; providing
    take care of kids, seniors, and hospital patients; aiding master card firms with fraud detection. AI technology has been
    applied to education within the recent twenty years. The Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) cowl all major AI topics
    (e.g., data illustration, machine learning, tongue, planning, reasoning, explanation), and therefore the systems has
    shaped a motivating test-bed to formalize psychological feature theories and to experiment with their
    operationalization. AI in education has been applied to numerous domains, like physics, programming, writing essays, and
    reading yet because the development of educational systems. the foremost typical AI applications within the academic
    field involve data</p>
